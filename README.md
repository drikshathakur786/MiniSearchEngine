# 🔍 Mini Search Engine

This repository contains the source code for our **Java + DSA** mini project: a console-based Mini Search Engine that supports document management and keyword searching using data structures like Trie, HashMap, and Lists. Built as part of our academic project to demonstrate the use of core data structures in real-world search problems.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📝 Add, update, or delete documents  
- 🧠 Lazy search with keyword suggestions (prefix-based)  

## 🧩 Data Structures Used

- `HashMap` — for fast retrieval of documents by exact keyword  
- `Trie` — for efficient prefix-based (lazy) suggestions  
- `HashSet` — to eliminate duplicate entries in search results  
- `List` — to return ordered suggestion results
